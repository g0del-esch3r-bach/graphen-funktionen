cloned from A001349, only thing that needs to be here is elements.cpp

elements.cpp takes in an adjacency matrix and value alpha and outputs the two values that we need for the cost function (average path length L, number of edges E) as well as the cost function itself

i have no clue how to dev using HTML and JS, so i got gpt to do it for me. how embarassing!

ok finally it worked??
